# rails-epidurio

This project was a proof of concept application for recording and follow-up of epidural insertion for labour analgesia, originally developed by [@timcknowles](https://github.com/timcknowles) and subsequently by a team at the first NHS Ideas Lab (November 2017)

Following a successful application for funding for further development, the main effort has shifted to a [new version](https://github.com/Epidurio/opal-epidur.io), written in the [Opal Framework](http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk), which in turn is based on Django and Angular.js.
